# You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer matrix grid of size n * n with values in the range [1, n2]. Each integer appears exactly once 
# except a which appears twice and b which is missing. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers a and b.

# Return a 0-indexed integer array ans of size 2 where ans[0] equals to a and ans[1] equals to b

class Solution:
    def findMissingAndRepeatedValues(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(grid)
        size = n*n
        count = [0] *(size+1)
        
        for i in range(n):          # Counting the frequency
            for j in range(n):
                count[grid[i][j]]+=1

        a = -1
        b = -1
        for num in range(1,size+1):
            if count[num] == 2:
                a = num
            if count[num] == 0:
                b = num
        return [a,b]
